#### Overview
Taking inspiration from the open bid writing approach being taken by Joss Winn at the University of Lincoln, and reflecting my own lack of success in actually taking bids through to submission, let alone completion, I'm going to start logging project ideas and outlines here that may (or may not!) be worked up into actual bid proposals.

If an idea listed here interests you, there at least three possible next steps:

* get in touch with me and we can have a chat about how to work the idea up further and take it forward somehow;
* grab the corresponding proposal, work it up, and submit it; please acknowledge the original idea appropriately; if you want to add me in to the bid as a nominated critical friend, or for a day or two of consultancy, please get in touch; (hmm... now I see why Joss gave each bid it's own repository: each bid can be separately forked and tracked... doh!)
* take the idea and run with. If you make oodles of cash from it, please consider donating at least 10% of the profit to a medical charity and a fair chunk to The Open University. And if you wanted to buy me a kite, that'd be nice too...
